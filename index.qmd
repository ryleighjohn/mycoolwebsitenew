## Goals

My goal is to be a Wildlife Biologist for the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation! New York is my home state, so I would
love to go back there and work.

## Education

I graduated with my bachelors degree in Biology from the University at
Albany, and now I am pursuing my masters in Wildlife and Conservation
Biology at the University of New Hampshire.

## Experience

I previously worked as an Environmental Intern and then as the Climate
Change Program Manager for the Seneca Nation Environmental Protection
Department.
